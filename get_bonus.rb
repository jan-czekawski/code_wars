# It's bonus time in the big city! The fatcats are rubbing their
# paws in anticipation... but who is going to make the most money?

# Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus).
# Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.

# If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If
# bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must 
# receive only his stated salary.

# Return the total figure the individual will receive as a string 
# prefixed with 'Â£' (JS and Java) or '$' (C#, C++, Ruby, Clojure, Elixir, PHP and Python).
