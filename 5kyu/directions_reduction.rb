# Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild west,…

# … a man was given directions to go from one point to another. 
# The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST". Clearly "NORTH" 
# and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too. Going to one direction 
# and coming back the opposite direction is a needless effort. Since this
# is the wild west, with dreadfull weather and not much water, it's 
# important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!

# How I crossed the desert the smart way.

# The directions given to the man are, for example, the following:

# ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"].
# or

# { "NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST" };
# or (haskell)

# [North, South, South, East, West, North, West]
# You can immediatly see that going "NORTH" and then "SOUTH" is not
# reasonable, better stay to the same place! So the task is to give
# to the man a simplified version of the plan. A better plan in this
# case is simply:

# ["WEST"]
# or

# { "WEST" }
# or (haskell)

# [West]
# or (rust)

# [WEST];
# Other examples:

# In ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST"], the direction "NORTH" + "SOUTH"
# is going north and coming back right away. What a waste of time! Better to do nothing.

# The path becomes ["EAST", "WEST"], now "EAST" and "WEST" annihilate
# each other, therefore, the final result is [] (nil in Clojure).

# In ["NORTH", "EAST", "WEST", "SOUTH", "WEST", "WEST"], "NORTH" and 
# "SOUTH" are not directly opposite but they become directly opposite 
# after the reduction of "EAST" and "WEST" so the whole path is reducible
# to ["WEST", "WEST"].

# Task

# Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and
# returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed
# (W<->E or S<->N side by side).

# The Haskell version takes a list of directions with data Direction =
# North | East | West | South. The Clojure version returns nil when
# the path is reduced to nothing. The Rust version takes a slice of
# enum Direction {NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST}.

# Examples

# dirReduc(["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"]) => ["WEST"]
# dirReduc(["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH"]) => []
# See more examples in "Example Tests"

# Note

# Not all paths can be made simpler. The path ["NORTH", "WEST",
# "SOUTH", "EAST"] is not reducible. "NORTH" and "WEST", "WEST" and
# "SOUTH", "SOUTH" and "EAST" are not directly opposite of each other
# and can't become such. Hence the result path is itself : ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"].
